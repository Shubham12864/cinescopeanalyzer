# üöÄ DEPLOYMENT GUIDE - Fix Search & Images
## This guide will deploy all the fixes we made to production

## üìã ISSUES FIXED IN LOCAL CODE:
‚úÖ Search functionality - returns query-specific results
‚úÖ Image loading - fixed circular references and cache errors
‚úÖ Backend stability - singleton pattern implementation
‚úÖ OMDB API integration - proper environment loading

## üéØ DEPLOYMENT STEPS:

### STEP 1: Deploy Backend to Railway
The backend fixes need to be deployed to Railway where your API is hosted.

**Commands to run in your terminal:**

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project root
cd c:\Users\Acer\Downloads\CineScopeAnalyzer

# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit the fixes
git commit -m "üîß Fix search functionality and image loading issues

- Fixed search returning same results for different queries
- Implemented context-aware enhanced search fallback
- Fixed image cache directory mapping (poster -> posters)  
- Added database constraint handling with INSERT OR REPLACE
- Prevented circular proxy URL references
- Added singleton pattern for service management
- Fixed OMDB API timeout and fallback logic"

# Push to main branch (triggers Railway deployment)
git push origin main
```

### STEP 2: Set Environment Variables on Railway
Go to your Railway dashboard and set these environment variables:

```
OMDB_API_KEY=2f777f63
BACKEND_URL=https://cinescopeanalyzer-production.up.railway.app
TMDB_API_KEY=9f362b6618db6e8a53976a51c2da62a4
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=tUbcUeO71VxtvH39HpnZeg
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=Qtxb5TxT8K4Uqonvp3E-qD9BJK32TA
REDDIT_USER_AGENT=CineScopeAnalyzer/2.0 (Enhanced Movie Analysis)
```

### STEP 3: Deploy Frontend to Vercel
The frontend changes will auto-deploy when you push to main, but verify deployment:

```bash
# Push will trigger Vercel deployment automatically
# Check deployment status at https://vercel.com/dashboard
```

### STEP 4: Verify Deployment
After deployment, test these URLs:

**Backend Health:**
https://cinescopeanalyzer-production.up.railway.app/health

**Search API:**
https://cinescopeanalyzer-production.up.railway.app/api/movies/search?q=batman&limit=3

**Frontend:**
https://cinescopeanalyzer.vercel.app

## üîç TESTING AFTER DEPLOYMENT:

### Test 1: Search Different Queries
- Search "batman" ‚Üí Should return Batman movies
- Search "inception" ‚Üí Should return Inception
- Search "marvel" ‚Üí Should return Marvel movies
- Each query should return DIFFERENT movies

### Test 2: Image Loading
- Images should show actual movie posters
- No more placeholder/clapboard icons
- Images should load without console errors

### Test 3: Backend API
- Search should work from the frontend
- Results should appear at the top (not below requiring scroll)
- Clicking on movies should show movie details

## üö® TROUBLESHOOTING:

### If search still doesn't work:
1. Check Railway logs for errors
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Check if deployment completed successfully

### If images still don't load:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify image proxy endpoints are working
3. Test image URLs directly

### If backend is down:
1. Check Railway service status
2. Review deployment logs
3. Verify railway.json configuration

## üì± QUICK DEPLOYMENT SCRIPT:
Run this all at once:

```bash
cd c:\Users\Acer\Downloads\CineScopeAnalyzer
git add .
git commit -m "üîß Fix search and image loading issues"
git push origin main
echo "‚úÖ Deployment triggered! Check Railway and Vercel dashboards"
```

## üéØ EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER DEPLOYMENT:
1. Search "batman" returns Batman-related movies
2. Search "inception" returns Inception movie  
3. Search "marvel" returns Marvel movies
4. All movie posters show actual images (not placeholder icons)
5. Search results appear at top of page
6. Clicking movies shows detailed information

**Note:** Deployment may take 2-5 minutes. Check Railway and Vercel dashboards for progress.
