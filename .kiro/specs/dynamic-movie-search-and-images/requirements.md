# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical issues in the CineScope movie application where images are not loading dynamically and search functionality is showing demo data instead of real movie results. The system currently falls back to mock/demo data too frequently and fails to properly load images from external sources, resulting in a poor user experience with placeholder images and limited search results.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Dynamic Image Loading System

**User Story:** As a user, I want movie posters to load properly from external sources, so that I can see actual movie artwork instead of placeholder images.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a movie poster URL is provided THEN the system SHALL attempt to load the image through the backend proxy
2. WHEN the backend proxy fails THEN the system SHALL attempt direct image loading with proper CORS handling
3. WHEN both proxy and direct loading fail THEN the system SHALL display a meaningful fallback image with movie title
4. IF an image URL contains "N/A" or is empty THEN the system SHALL immediately use the fallback image
5. WHEN images are loading THEN the system SHALL display a loading spinner or skeleton
6. WHEN an image loads successfully THEN the loading state SHALL be removed smoothly

### Requirement 2: Real-Time Movie Search

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search for any movie and get real results from external APIs, so that I can find current and comprehensive movie information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I search for a movie THEN the system SHALL query OMDB API and web scraping tools for real-time results
2. WHEN external APIs return results THEN the system SHALL display them with proper images and metadata
3. WHEN external APIs fail THEN the system SHALL attempt alternative data sources before falling back to cached data
4. IF no results are found THEN the system SHALL display a clear "no results" message instead of demo data
5. WHEN search results are returned THEN they SHALL include proper poster images loaded through the image proxy
6. WHEN a search is cleared THEN the system SHALL return to the home page with trending/popular movies

### Requirement 3: Backend API Integration Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to reliably connect to the backend and fetch real movie data, so that I see current and accurate movie information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL test backend connectivity and load real movie data
2. WHEN the backend is available THEN the system SHALL prioritize real API data over mock data
3. WHEN backend requests fail THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff before falling back
4. IF the backend is completely unavailable THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate demo mode to the user
5. WHEN backend connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh with real data
6. WHEN loading real data THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states

### Requirement 4: Image Proxy Service Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the image proxy service to handle various image sources reliably, so that users see movie posters consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image URL is proxied THEN the system SHALL handle CORS issues transparently
2. WHEN the proxy service receives an invalid URL THEN it SHALL return a proper error response
3. WHEN image loading times out THEN the system SHALL fall back to alternative sources
4. IF multiple image sources are available THEN the system SHALL try them in priority order
5. WHEN an image is successfully loaded THEN it SHALL be cached for future requests
6. WHEN the proxy service is unavailable THEN direct image loading SHALL be attempted

### Requirement 5: User Experience Improvements

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth and responsive interactions when browsing and searching movies, so that the application feels professional and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are loading THEN smooth loading animations SHALL be displayed
2. WHEN search results are loading THEN a loading state SHALL be shown
3. WHEN errors occur THEN clear, actionable error messages SHALL be displayed
4. IF the backend is in demo mode THEN a notification SHALL inform the user
5. WHEN switching between real and demo data THEN the transition SHALL be seamless
6. WHEN images fail to load THEN the fallback SHALL maintain the layout integrity
