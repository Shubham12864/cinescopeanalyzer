# Enhanced Image Proxy Service Implementation Summary

## Task 2: Enhance Image Proxy Service ✅ COMPLETED

### Task 2.1: Improve image proxy endpoint error handling ✅ COMPLETED

**Implemented Features:**

1. **URL Validation and Sanitization**
   - Added `validate_and_sanitize_url()` function
   - Cleans URLs by removing whitespace and newlines
   - Validates URL format and scheme (HTTPS only)
   - Rejects invalid values like "N/A", "null", empty strings
   - Provides security checks to prevent URL abuse

2. **Retry Mechanism with Different Headers**
   - Implemented `try_proxy_with_retry()` with up to 2 retries
   - Uses different User-Agent strings and headers for each attempt
   - Includes exponential backoff between retries (0.5s, 1s, 2s)
   - Handles various HTTP clients and browser signatures

3. **Proper Timeout Handling**
   - Set 10-second timeout for all HTTP requests
   - Handles timeout exceptions gracefully
   - Provides fallback when timeouts occur

4. **Meaningful Fallback Image Generation**
   - Added `generate_fallback_image()` function using Pillow
   - Creates custom fallback images with movie titles
   - Includes film strip visual effects and proper typography
   - Handles text wrapping for long titles
   - Generates PNG format with proper aspect ratios (300x450)
   - Added Pillow==10.1.0 to requirements.txt

### Task 2.2: Add image proxy route compatibility ✅ COMPLETED

**Implemented Features:**

1. **Dual Route Support**
   - Enhanced `/api/images/image-proxy` as the main service
   - Added `/api/movies/image-proxy` compatibility route that redirects to main service
   - Both routes use the same enhanced functionality

2. **Proper CORS Headers**
   - Added comprehensive CORS headers to all responses:
     - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`
     - `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, OPTIONS`
     - `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization`
   - Added CORS preflight support with OPTIONS endpoints
   - Set `Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400` for preflight caching

3. **Caching Headers for Performance**
   - Successful images: `Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600` (1 hour)
   - Fallback images: `Cache-Control: public, max-age=1800` (30 minutes)
   - Error fallbacks: `Cache-Control: public, max-age=300` (5 minutes)
   - CORS preflight: `Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400` (24 hours)

## Technical Improvements

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Comprehensive exception handling for different error types
- Proper HTTP status codes (400, 404, 500)
- Detailed logging without exposing sensitive information
- Graceful degradation to fallback images

### Performance Optimizations
- Connection pooling with httpx limits
- Proper content-type validation
- URL encoding for special characters
- Efficient image generation with PIL

### Security Enhancements
- URL validation to prevent abuse
- HTTPS-only requirement
- Input sanitization
- Rate limiting preparation (connection limits)

## Integration Updates

### Movie Service Integration
- Updated `process_movie_images()` to use enhanced proxy service
- Added URL encoding for special characters
- Improved fallback logic for cache failures
- Better error handling and logging

### Requirements Update
- Added Pillow==10.1.0 for image generation capabilities

## Testing
- Created comprehensive test suite (`test_enhanced_image_proxy.py`)
- Verified URL validation functionality
- Tested fallback image generation
- Confirmed proper error handling

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **Requirement 1.2**: System attempts to load images through backend proxy  
✅ **Requirement 1.3**: Meaningful fallback images when proxy fails  
✅ **Requirement 4.1**: CORS issues handled transparently  
✅ **Requirement 4.2**: Proper error responses for invalid URLs  
✅ **Requirement 4.3**: Timeout handling with fallback sources  
✅ **Requirement 1.1**: Both proxy routes work correctly  
✅ **Requirement 4.5**: Image caching implemented

The enhanced image proxy service now provides robust, reliable image loading with comprehensive error handling, meaningful fallbacks, and excellent performance characteristics.
