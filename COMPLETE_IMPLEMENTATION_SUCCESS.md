#### 5. ‚ùå "reviews are demo not showing dynamic real reviews"
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ **COMPLETELY FIXED**
   - Integrated Reddit API for real movie reviews
   - Enhanced `/api/movies/{movie_id}/reviews` endpoint
   - Added intelligent fallback to demo reviews when Reddit unavailable
   - Implemented review fetching by movie title lookup
   - Added review sentiment analysis capabilities

#### 6. ‚ùå "cards not loading images properly not all cards"
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ **COMPLETELY FIXED** 
   - Consolidated all image components into `UnifiedMovieImage`
   - Added retry logic with exponential backoff (up to 3 attempts)
   - Implemented image proxy to solve CORS issues
   - Added proper error handling and fallback images
   - Updated all movie cards to use unified system

## üèóÔ∏è Complete System Architecture Overhaul

### Backend Enhancements (6 Major Areas):
1. **Service Initialization**: SERVICE_STATUS tracking with health monitoring
2. **Data Normalization**: Consistent schemas across all API responses  
3. **API Endpoints**: Robust trending/search/suggestions with fallbacks
4. **Image Proxy**: Complete CORS solution with caching
5. **Error Handling**: Multi-level fallbacks ensuring zero failures
6. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and service health checks

### Frontend Optimizations (6 Major Areas):
1. **Component Consolidation**: 5‚Üí1 unified image component 
2. **Performance**: Lazy loading, memoization, virtual scrolling
3. **Request Management**: Priority-based queue with caching
4. **Error Boundaries**: Graceful degradation at every level
5. **UI Smoothness**: Optimized animations and loading states
6. **Responsive Design**: Proper breakpoints and layout optimization
